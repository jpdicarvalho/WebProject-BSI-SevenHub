Well, I'm prioritizing the construction of the Back-End of the application first, that's why sometimes
Pages are minimally styled. therefore, the Back-End is in the following situation:

a) Registration of users; (done)
b) login validation of users; (done) and
c) restricted session of the Company user:
-offers consultation of different types of registered devs;(made for Front-End devs) and
-update of registered data. (not done)
c) Developer user restricted session:
-update of registered data. (not done)

After completing all the Back-End steps, all that remains is to create a standardized platform styling.

Well, the styling of the project is already fully done and now only the features listed below are missing:

a) Implement the 'Edit Profile' functionality belonging to the restricted area of ​​the developer user;
b) Import the user's data to the 'view profile' page so that he can see how his profile is being presented;
c) Implement the functionality of 'View Profile' of the developers listed in the restricted area of ​​the company user.
